# appID-2-acctID

Using an undocumented, "internalonly", API for `amplify:GetDistributionDetails`, we can provide an AWS Amplify App ID and get the AWS Account ID associated with it.

## Note

As of March 24th, 2023 this technique no longer works. AWS has disabled the API. This repo will remain available as a means of showing a neat vuln in an AWS API.
